# git-blame can be instructed to ignore certain commits, which is useful to do
# for commits that only involve large refactoring and reformatting operations.
# The format of this file is one full 40-character commit hash (SHA-1) per line.
# Blank lines and comments (such as this) are allowed.
#
# Usage: run the following command to configure git to use this file as a
# default ignore file for git blame:
#
#   git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
