# Problem Matchers

GitHub [Problem
Matchers](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/docs/problem-matchers.md)
are a mechanism that enable workflow steps to scan the outputs of GitHub
Actions for regex patterns and automatically write annotations in the workflow
summary page. Using Problem Matchers allows information to be displayed more
prominently in the GitHub user interface.

This directory contains Problem Matchers used by the GitHub Actions workflows
in the [`workflows`](./workflows) subdirectory.
