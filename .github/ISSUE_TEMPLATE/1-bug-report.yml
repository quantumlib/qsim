        Thank you for taking the time to open an issue report. Before
        continuing, it's worth [searching through the existing issues in this
        repository](https://github.com/quantumlib/qsim/issues?q=is%3Aissue) in
        case the same topic has already been reported.

        Explain in a step-by-step fashion what someone else will need to
        do in order to reproduce the issue. If possible, include literal
        examples of commands or code using [Markdown fenced code
        blocks](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).
        For long output, paste the text into [collapsed

        or attach text files.

      description: |-
        For qsim software problems, we need to know the exact version you are
        using. If you are using the Python package and are running within a
        terminal emulator, then typing the following command in the shell will
        print the version number:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        ```python3 -c 'import qsimcirq; print(qsimcirq.__version__)'```<br>
        If you are using a Google Colab or Jupyter notebook environment,
        then running the following command in a notebook cell will print
        the version number:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        `import qsimcirq; print(qsimcirq.__version__)`

        Please tell us if you are using Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Colab, or
        something else, and its version. If you are trying to use a GPU and
        CUDA, please tell us the model of GPU and version of CUDA.
