# Explanation for why file changes are tested using this workflow.
#
# GitHub Actions workflows can have path filters (i.e., the use of "paths:"
# keywords on event triggers in the "on:" block of a workflow). That *would* be
# the natural way to run workflows only when the relevant files are changed in
# a PR – except that the way GitHub branch protection rules work is: "If a
# workflow is skipped due to path filtering [...] the checks associated with
# that workflow will remain in a Pending state. A PR that requires those checks
# to be successful will be blocked from merging." Blocking merges is not
# acceptable. Surprisingly, GitHub doesn't provide an alternative. So, we forgo
# path filters, and instead check file changes using this small workflow.
