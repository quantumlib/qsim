# Run-time dependencies for qsimcirq. This file is read from pyproject.toml.

# Core dependencies:
absl-py
cirq-core~=1.0
numpy>=1.26.0,<2.0; python_version < '3.11'
numpy>=2.0; python_version >= '3.11'

# These are transitive dependencies we need to constrain to avoid unresolvable
# installation conflicts due to them requiring higher Python versions:
scipy<1.16; python_version < '3.11'
contourpy<1.3; python_version < '3.11'
