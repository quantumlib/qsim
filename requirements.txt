# Installation and run-time dependencies for qsimcirq. This file is read
# by pyproject.toml.

absl-py
cirq-core~=1.0
numpy>=1.26.0,<2.0; python_version < '3.11'
numpy>=2.0; python_version >= '3.11'

# These are needed because installing qsimcirq in some environments may require
# pip to compile Pybind for that specific platform:
cmake~=3.28.1
pybind11[global]

# These are transitive dependencies we need to constrain to avoid unresolvable
# installation conflicts due to them requiring higher Python versions:
scipy<1.16; python_version < '3.11'
contourpy<1.3; python_version < '3.11'
