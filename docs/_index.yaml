        <h4>qsim</h4>
        <p>
        qsim is a full wave function simulator written in C++. It uses gate
        fusion, AVX/FMA vectorized instructions and multi-threading using
        OpenMP to achieve state of the art simulations of quantum circuits.
        qsim is integrated with Cirq and can be used to run simulations of up
        to 40 qubits on a 90 core Intel Xeon workstation.

        Cirq is a python framework for writing, simulating, and executing
        quantum programs. Cirq's built in simulator is useful to around 20
        qubits. By using the qsim Cirq simulator one can boost the number of
        qubits simulated to be mostly limited by available ram. Up to 40 qubits
        can be simulated on a 90 core Intel Xeon workstation.
