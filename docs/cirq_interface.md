# The Cirq Interface

This file provides examples of how to use qsim with the
[Cirq](https://github.com/quantumlib/cirq) Python library.

qsim is kept up-to-date with the latest version of Cirq. If you experience
compatibility issues, please file an issue in the qsim or Cirq repository
as appropriate.


## Setting up

There are two methods for setting up the qsim-Cirq interface on your local
machine: installing directly with `pip`, or compiling from the source code.

Prerequisites:
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/): this is used to compile the C++ qsim libraries.
CMake can be installed with `apt-get install cmake`.
- [Pybind](https://github.com/pybind): this creates Python wrappers for the C++
libraries, and can be installed with `pip3 install pybind11`.
- [Cirq](https://cirq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html).

### Installing with pip

qsim can be installed with `pip3 install qsimcirq`. Alternatives (such as
installing with Docker) can be found in the
[installation doc](./install_qsimcirq.md).

### Compiling qsimcirq

1. Clone the qsim repository to your machine, and navigate to the top-level
`qsim` directory:
```
git clone git@github.com:quantumlib/qsim.git
cd qsim
```

2. Compile qsim using the top-level Makefile: `make`. By default, this will use
Pybind to generate a static library with file extension `.so` in the `qsimcirq`
directory.

3. To verify successful compilation, run the Python tests:
```
make run-py-tests
```
This will run
[qsimcirq_test](https://github.com/quantumlib/qsim/blob/master/qsimcirq_tests/qsimcirq_test.py),
which invokes qsim through the qsim-Cirq interface.

## Interface design and operations

The purpose of this interface is to provide a performant simulator for quantum
circuits defined in Cirq.

### Classes

The interface includes QSimSimulator and QSimhSimulator which communicate
through a Pybind11 interface with qsim. The simulator accepts `cirq.Circuit`
objects, which it wraps as `QSimCircuit` to enforce architectural constraints
(such as decomposing to qsim-supported gate sets).

### Usage procedure

We begin by defining a Cirq circuit which we want to simulate.

```
my_circuit = cirq.Circuit()
```

This circuit can then be simulated using either `QSimSimulator` or
`QSimhSimulator`, depending on the desired output.

#### QSimSimulator

`QSimSimulator` uses a Schrödinger full state-vector simulator, suitable for
acquiring the complete state of a reasonably-sized circuit (~25 qubits on an
average PC, or up to 40 qubits on high-performance VMs).

Options for the simulator, including number of threads and verbosity, can be
set with the `qsim_options` field, which accepts a `QSimOptions` object as
defined in
[qsim_simulator.py](https://github.com/quantumlib/qsim/blob/master/qsimcirq/qsim_simulator.py).
These options can also be passed as a {str: val} dict, using the format
described by that class.

```
# equivalent to {'t': 8, 'v': 0}
qsim_options = qsimcirq.QSimOptions(cpu_threads=8, verbosity=0)
my_sim = qsimcirq.QSimSimulator(qsim_options)
myres = my_sim.simulate(program=my_circuit)
```

Alternatively, by using the `compute_amplitudes` method `QSimSimulator` can
produce amplitudes for specific output bitstrings:
```
my_sim = qsimcirq.QSimSimulator()
myres = my_sim.compute_amplitudes(program=my_circuit,
                                  bitstrings=[0b00, 0b01, 0b10, 0b11])
```
In the example above, the simulation is performed for the specified bitstrings
of length 2. All the bitstring lengths should be equal to the number of qubits
in `qsim_circuit`. Otherwise, `BitstringsFromStream` will raise an error.

Finally, to retrieve sample measurements the `run` method can be used. This requires
the circuit to have measurements to sample from, else an error will be raised.
```
my_sim = qsimcirq.QSimSimulator()
myres = my_sim.run(program=my_circuit)
```

This method may be more efficient if the final state vector is very large, as
it only returns a bitstring produced by sampling from the final state. It also
allows intermediate measurements to be applied to the circuit.

Note that requesting multiple repetitions with the `run` method will execute
the circuit once for each repetition unless all measurements are terminal. This
ensures that nondeterminism from intermediate measurements is properly
reflected in the results.

In rare cases when the state vector and gate matrices have many zero entries
(denormal numbers), a significant performance slowdown can occur. Set
the `denormals_are_zeros` option to `True` to prevent this issue potentially
at the cost of a tiny precision loss:

```
# equivalent to {'t': 8, 'v': 0, 'z': True}
qsim_options = qsimcirq.QSimOptions(cpu_threads=8, verbosity=0, denormals_are_zeros=True)
my_sim = qsimcirq.QSimSimulator(qsim_options)
myres = my_sim.simulate(program=my_circuit)
```

#### QSimhSimulator

`QSimhSimulator` uses a hybrid Schrödinger-Feynman simulator. This limits it to
returning amplitudes for specific output bitstrings, but raises its upper
bound on number of qubits simulated (50+ qubits, depending on circuit depth).

To acquire amplitudes for all output bitstrings of length 2:
```
qsimh_options = {
    'k': [0],
    'w': 0,
    'p': 0,
    'r': 2
}
my_sim = qsimcirq.QSimhSimulator(qsimh_options)
myres = my_sim.compute_amplitudes(program=my_circuit,
                                  bitstrings=[0b00, 0b01, 0b10, 0b11])
```

As with `QSimSimulator`, the options follow the flag format for `qsimh_base`
outlined in the [usage docs](./usage.md).

## Additional features

The qsim-Cirq interface supports arbitrary gates and circuit parameterization.
Additionally, GPU execution of circuits can be requested if GPUs are available.

### Gate decompositions

Circuits received by qsimcirq are automatically decomposed into the qsim
gate set if possible. This uses the Cirq `decompose` operation. Gates with no
decomposition to the qsim gate set will instead attempt to be parsed as raw
matrices, if one is specified.

### Parametrized circuits

`QSimCircuit` objects can also contain
[parameterized gates](https://cirq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/tutorials/basics.html#Using-parameter-sweeps)
which have values assigned by Cirq's `ParamResolver`. See the link above for
details on how to use this feature.

### GPU execution

`QSimSimulator` provides optional support for GPU execution of circuits, which
may improve performance. In order to use this feature, qsim must be compiled on
a device with the [CUDA toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
and run on a device with available NVIDIA GPUs.

Compilation for GPU follows the same steps outlined in the
[Compiling qsimcirq](./cirq_interface.md#compiling-qsimcirq) section.
To compile with the NVIDIA cuStateVec library (v1.0.0 or higher is required),
set the environmment variable `CUQUANTUM_ROOT` to the path to the cuStateVec
library.

`QSimOptions` provides five parameters to configure GPU execution. `use_gpu`
is required to enable GPU execution:
* `use_gpu`: if True, use GPU instead of CPU for simulation.
* `gpu_mode`: use CUDA if set to 0 (default value) or use the NVIDIA cuStateVec
library if set to any other value.

If `use_gpu` is set and `gpu_mode` is set to 0, the remaining parameters can
optionally be set to fine-tune StateSpace performance for a specific device.
In most cases, the default values provide good performance.
* `gpu_state_threads`: number of threads per CUDA block to use for the GPU
StateSpace. This must be a power of 2 in the range [32, 1024].
* `gpu_data_blocks`: number of data blocks to use for the GPU StateSpace.
Below 16 data blocks, performance is noticeably reduced.
