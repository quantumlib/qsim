# Summary: tell Gemini CLI what it should or should not ignore. Takes precedence
# over .gitignore (which Gemini CLI also reads), thus can be used to un-ignore
# files that shouldn't be committed to git yet should be visible to Gemini. Also
# used to ignore things usually in people's global .gitignore files.

# Not in .gitignore because it's a submodule. Need to tell Gemini to ignore it.
